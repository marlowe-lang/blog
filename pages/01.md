## Marlowe Oracle Protocol

In this article we will explore how oracles can interact with Marlowe contracts in a transparent way so all involved parties can have a clear understanding of the contract logic and the data that is being used to make decisions. This protocol is based on the idea of a "pull" architecture where the contract requests data from the oracle and the oracle responds with the requested data. Additionally oracles can easily detect if a given contract pays them back for the data they provide.

## Detecting Marlowe Data Request

Marlowe language is by design restricted and structured in such a way that many properties of programs written in it can be programaticaly assessed. Additionally either full or large chunks of a contract are present on the chain in the UTxO `datum` which makes it possible to observe, detect and analyze at least this visible parts.
This context allows us to build a pretty unique "pull" (or request-response) based architectures with Marlowe language.

### Discoverability

Marlowe can be easily detected on the chain because it clearly separates interpreter which is represented and provided as a spending validator and the code which is encoded in the datum. The validator hash is well specified and some platforms like cardanoscan or marlowescan.io and tools like Marlowe Runtime can help detect UTxOs which are valid Marlowe contracts.
